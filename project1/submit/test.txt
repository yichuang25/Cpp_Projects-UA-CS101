Cryptography is both the practice and study of the techniques used to communicate and/or store information or data privately and securely, without being intercepted by third parties. This can include processes such as encryption, hashing, and steganography. Until the modern era, cryptography almost exclusively referred to encryption, but now cryptography is a broad field with applications in many critical areas of our lives.
